            <p>
                I am looking for <span class="text-cyan-500">Senior Engineering Manager</span> positions either <span
                    class="text-cyan-500">hybrid in Barcelona</span
                >
                or <span class="text-cyan-500">remote</span>. I would also consider Engineering Manager positions if the
                project and the company are compelling enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have more than 10 years of experience leading mostly Frontend teams (React stack), but I am more than
                open to manage backend teams too!
            </p>
            <p>
                The perfect job would be leading a group of teams and being the people manager for both ICs and other
                Engineering Managers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would also be happy leading a team of high-performing ICs, bonus points if the team has potential for
                growth and I can help them do it in an efficient and orderly manner!

        <section class="mt-8" id="about">
            <h2 class="text-white flex w-full gap-x-2 py-4"><About class="size-10" />About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Senior Engineering Manager with more than 10 years of experience leading software engineering
                teams in agile environments, and leading and mentoring other Engineering Managers.
            </p>
            <p>Before that I was a software <span class="text-cyan-500">developer for 8 years</span>.</p>
            <p>
                I have a track record of building and growing high-performing teams, which in my book means teams that
                are autonomous, accountable, deliver quality software incrementally, and learn from their own mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                My values are <span class="text-cyan-500">respect</span> (both for others and myself), <span
                    class="text-cyan-500">honesty</span
                >, <span class="text-cyan-500">transparency</span>, and <span class="text-cyan-500">responsibility</span
                >.
            </p>
            <p>
                Above all else, I am a flawed human being who tries her best to be a good person and a good
                professional. I thrive on bringing order to chaos, solving problems, and helping others reach their full
                potential.
