Welcome to my _new blog_ about Engineering Management and possibly other semi-random stuff!
This is me on the right, Paty Cuenca.
I don't have many expectations about either myself or this blog, and you shouldn't either ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## First, what's this?

My quarterly attempt at keeping in touch with my technical side.
This time it took the form of writing my portfolio while learning a new framework (Astro).
And since I finished that up quite quickly, I created a blog also using Astro.
And here we are!

## What's next

If insipiration hits, I will keep writing about what I know, which is mostly `management stuff`.
Or not.
Only time will tell!
