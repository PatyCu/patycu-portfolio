On January 31st I found myself unemployed. I would say it was unexpected, and it certainly was a surprise, but I had known for a while that it was coming.

And alas! It finally happened.

Luckily I was able to find a good opportunity in less than a month, and after a few weeks to rest and recharge I will rejoin the workforce ready to kick ass.
On a less positive note, I have experienced first-hand how the job market has dramatically changed since the last time I switched jobs.
Here are my thoughts.

## The good

All folks working in tech know that laying off employees has become a sad

## The bad

blablabla

## The ugly
